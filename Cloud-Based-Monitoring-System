# Cloud-Based Monitoring and Control System

## Overview
This project demonstrates an IoT-based system for real-time environmental monitoring and control, integrating multiple sensors with microcontrollers and cloud services.

## Features
- **Sensors:** Measures temperature, humidity, water levels, light intensity, and distance.
- **Hardware:** Combines Arduino Uno for data acquisition and Raspberry Pi for data processing and cloud communication.
- **Software:** Python programming, MQTT, and HTTP protocols for seamless data transfer and control.
- **Cloud Integration:** Utilized ThingsBoard for visualization, remote control, and alert notifications.

## Components
- **Hardware:**
  - Arduino Uno
  - Raspberry Pi
  - DHT11 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor)
  - Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
  - Light Sensor
  - Water Level Sensor
- **Software:**
  - Python scripts for data handling and control
  - ThingsBoard platform for cloud integration
  - MQTT and HTTP for data transfer protocols

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Connect the hardware as specified in the [wiring diagram](path-to-diagram).
3. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run `main.py` to start the system.
5. Monitor data and control devices through the ThingsBoard dashboard.

## Results
